summary: |
  Story 2.2 wires the existing static chart page into Netlify by publishing the
  web/ directory as a static site. Behavior matches the story: the deployed URL
  serves the chart built in Story 2.1, loads chart-data.json from the expected
  path, and relies on manual data refresh for MVP as documented.

    level: medium
    description: >-
      Keeping chart-data.json in sync with the pipeline is currently a manual
      git+deploy step. There is a risk of stale data if deploys are not
      triggered regularly.
    mitigation: >-
      Add a future story to hook successful pipeline CI runs to a Netlify
      deploy, automating chart-data.json refresh.
