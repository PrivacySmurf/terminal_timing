summary: |
  Story 2.1 implements a static TradingView Lightweight Charts page that loads
  chart-data.json and renders BTC price and phase score with basic
  interactions and Notion-friendly layout. Behavior matches acceptance
  criteria and architecture; Dev and prior QA validation confirm the
  implementation.
risks:
  - id: notion-embed-layout
    level: low
    description: >-
      Horizontal scroll and iframe sizing behavior in real Notion embeds has
      only been approximated; final visual behavior should be verified when
      wiring up Notion integration in later stories.
    mitigation: >-
      Validate chart layout inside a real Notion embed during Story 2.3 and
      adjust CSS/container sizing if needed.
