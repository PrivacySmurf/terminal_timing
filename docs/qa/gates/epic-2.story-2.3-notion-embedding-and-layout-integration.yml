notes:
  - "Netlify-hosted chart is embedded in the designated Notion page via embed block."
  - "Chart is visible above the fold on a typical desktop viewport with deliberate layout."
  - "Zoom/pan/tooltips work inside the Notion embed; no awkward horizontal scrollbars at common widths."
  - "Copy near the chart explains the metric, how to explore it, and includes a minimal disclaimer."
  - "Embedding process documented in docs/notion-embedding-guide.md with guidance for future updates."
risks:
  - "Notion mobile experience may be constrained; currently accepted as an MVP limitation."
  - "Behavior depends on Netlify availability; no additional redundancy at this layer."
recommendations:
  - "Capture a short Loom or screenshot walkthrough in Notion for non-technical stakeholders (optional)."
  - "Revisit mobile UX in a later story if Notion usage on phones becomes primary."
