# Story 2.3: Notion Embedding & Layout Integration

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As** a Timing Terminal member reading the chart inside Notion  
**I want** the embedded chart to render cleanly within a Notion page  
**so that** I can explore the Bitcoin price and phase score without leaving the content and onboarding context.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Chart embeds correctly in a Notion page**  
   - The Netlify-hosted chart URL from Story 2.2 is embedded into a Notion page using Notion’s embed or bookmark capabilities.  
   - The chart is fully visible without awkward scrollbars at typical desktop widths.  
   - Interactions (zoom, pan, tooltips) still work inside the Notion embed.

2. **Above-the-fold layout matches MVP expectations**  
   - The Notion page is structured so that the chart appears above the fold on a typical desktop screen (no major scrolling required to see the chart).  
   - Supporting content (value proposition, brief methodology, track record pointer) is visible near the chart as described in the PRD.  
   - The embed sizing and alignment feel deliberate, not like a raw iframe dropped into the page.

3. **Responsive behavior in Notion**  
   - At common viewport widths (e.g., 1024–1440px), the embedded chart maintains a reasonable aspect ratio and does not produce horizontal scrollbars.  
   - On narrower widths (e.g., tablets), the chart is still usable, even if less optimal (MVP-quality responsiveness).

4. **Copy and context support exploration behavior**  
   - The Notion page copy near the chart encourages users to:  
     - Zoom into key historical periods (e.g., 2021 peak, 2022 bottom).  
     - Use tooltips/crosshair to align BTC price and phase score.  
   - There is a clear, concise explanation of what the chart represents and a minimal disclaimer (e.g., “not financial advice”).

5. **Embedding documented for future environments**  
   - Dev Notes / docs explain:  
     - How to obtain the Netlify URL for embedding.  
     - How to add/update the embed in Notion.  
     - Any known limitations (e.g., Notion mobile app behavior, refresh characteristics).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1 – Configure Notion page structure** (AC: 1, 2, 4)  
  - [ ] Create or identify the Notion page that will host the MVP chart.  
  - [ ] Arrange sections so that the chart appears above the fold with supporting copy nearby.  
  - [ ] Add a short methodology blurb and a link or text pointing to historical validation content (as per the PRD).

- [ ] **Task 2 – Embed the Netlify chart URL in Notion** (AC: 1)  
  - [ ] Copy the Netlify site URL (e.g., `https://<site-name>.netlify.app`).  
  - [ ] Use Notion’s embed (or bookmark) block to embed the chart.  
  - [ ] Adjust the block width/height as needed so the chart is clearly visible.

- [ ] **Task 3 – Validate layout and interaction in Notion** (AC: 1, 2, 3)  
  - [ ] On desktop, confirm:  
    - Chart is visible without scrolling.  
    - Zoom/pan and tooltips work as expected inside the embed.  
    - No horizontal scrollbars appear for typical widths.  
  - [ ] On at least one narrower viewport (e.g., resizing browser window), confirm the chart remains usable (no broken layout).

- [ ] **Task 4 – Refine copy and context around the embed** (AC: 2, 4)  
  - [ ] Add a concise description of what the chart shows (BTC price + proprietary phase score).  
  - [ ] Add a brief “how to explore” section (e.g., “Zoom into 2021 peak, compare phase score levels to current”).  
  - [ ] Add or confirm presence of a minimal disclaimer (“not financial advice”).

- [ ] **Task 5 – Document the embedding process** (AC: 5)  
  - [ ] Add a section to `docs/` or Notion itself describing:  
    - How to update the embed if the Netlify URL changes.  
    - Any known quirks (e.g., caching, mobile behavior).  
    - Recommended embed dimensions or aspect ratio.

## Dev Notes

> This story is primarily about integration and layout, not code changes to the chart itself.

### Architectural & Product Context

- **Product Experience:** The PRD emphasizes that the chart should live alongside explanatory content and onboarding, so users see context and chart together rather than a bare technical view.  
- **Embedding Medium:** Notion is the initial wrapper for both content and chart, so this story ensures the embed feels first-class and usable.

### Implementation Guidance

- **Netlify URL Stability:**  
  - Use the primary Netlify production URL (or a custom domain if configured) for the embed.  
  - Avoid using deploy previews or branch-specific URLs for the main Notion embed.

- **Sizing & Aspect Ratio:**  
  - The chart’s 16:9 container from Story 2.1 should generally fit well in Notion’s embed frames; adjust the embed block size as needed.  
  - Avoid extremely tall or narrow blocks that distort the visual balance between chart and copy.

- **Copy Placement:**  
  - Keep the core value proposition and a 1–2 sentence methodology summary near the chart.  
  - Put longer explanations or historical deep dives below the fold to keep the landing experience focused.

### Testing Expectations

- **Manual:**  
  - Verify that the chart is functional inside Notion on a desktop browser.  
  - Optionally, verify in the Notion desktop app and at least one mobile device to note any UX issues.

### Non-Goals

- No changes to access control or referer validation (that’s Story 2.4).  
- No changes to the chart’s underlying data pipeline or scoring logic.

## Testing

- **Manual:**  
  - Validate the embedded chart in Notion across typical viewport sizes and note any layout issues.
