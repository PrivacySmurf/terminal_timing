# Success Criteria

### User Success

User success for public_plots is measured through observable behavioral patterns that indicate confidence-building and systematic decision-making rather than direct portfolio performance (which we cannot measure).

**Marcus Segment (Experienced Investors) - Confidence Through Validation:**

**Primary Success Indicator:** Marcus uses the hub to make systematic timing decisions with confidence, replacing emotional reactions with data-driven execution.

**Leading Indicators (Aha Path):**
- Chart interaction within 30 seconds of landing
- Zoom within first 2 minutes
- Historical exploration (2020–2022) in first session
- Examination of the 2021 peak in first session

**Aha Moment Definition:**
First instance of zooming into the 2021 peak, validating phase score hit ~85 before the top, and comparing to current trajectory – realization: "I can verify this methodology myself."

**Key Behaviors After Aha:**
- Historical pattern exploration (2021 peak + 2022 bottom)
- Critical phase monitoring as scores approach decision zones (75–85+)
- Strategic visit patterns (3–5 checks per week during transitions)
- Deep engagement (90+ seconds per session, active zoom/pan)

**Success Milestone:** Marcus makes a systematic position adjustment (e.g., reduce 40% at Phase Score 80+) based on chart exploration rather than Twitter sentiment.

**Sarah Segment (First-Cycle Investors) – Learning Progression (Phase 1.5):**

Primary indicator: Sarah develops a systematic timing framework, moving from FOMO/panic to phase-based decisions.

Leading indicators and aha moments revolve around completing guided tutorials (2021 peak, 2022 bottom), reduced tooltip reliance, and switching from "educational" to "advanced" mode.

### Business Success (3-Month Focus)

**Conversion Performance:**
- Target: 10–12% newsletter → paid conversion (Marcus-focused MVP)
- Below 7%: concerning; value proposition not resonating
- Above 15%: exceptional; strong validation of premium positioning

**Engagement Quality:**
- 60%+ of paid members check hub 2+ times per week
- 50%+ use zoom/pan/historical exploration monthly
- Average time-on-chart: 90+ seconds per session
- First-session zoom rate: 60%+

**Retention:**
- Month 3 retention: 60%+ after early churn stabilizes

**Community Validation:**
- 5+ chart requests in first 3 months
- Unsolicited testimonials about decision confidence and systematic execution
- Discord activity mentioning phase-score–influenced decisions

**Revenue Momentum:**
- Trajectory toward 50+ members and $750–1,000 MRR by month 6

### Technical Success (High-Level)

Technical success focuses on reliable delivery of daily-updated interactive charts with correct phase scores.

High-level targets include:
- Pipeline uptime: 95% in neutral markets, 99% in critical zones (<20 or >80)
- Recovery SLA: within 24h (neutral) / 4h (critical)
- Prominent "Last updated" transparency on Notion page
- Chart performance: <2s load time, smooth 60fps interaction on major browsers
- Data accuracy: backtested phase scores for 2021 peak (~85) and 2022 bottom (~12) remain stable and verifiable.
