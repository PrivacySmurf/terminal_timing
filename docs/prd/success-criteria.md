# Success Criteria

## User Success

User success for public_plots is measured through observable behavioral patterns that indicate confidence-building and systematic decision-making rather than direct portfolio performance (which we cannot measure).

**Marcus Segment (Experienced Investors) - Confidence Through Validation:**

**Primary Success Indicator:** Marcus uses the hub to make systematic timing decisions with confidence, replacing emotional reactions with data-driven execution.

**Path to Aha Moment - Leading Indicators:**

The first 60 seconds after landing on the Notion page are critical - this is where the aha moment happens or the user bounces.

- **Chart interaction within 30 seconds** of landing (indicates clear value prop and low friction)
- **Zoom action within first 2 minutes** (indicates exploration behavior activated)
- **Historical period exploration** (2020-2022 range) in first session (indicates validation seeking)
- **2021 peak examination** in first session (indicates methodology verification behavior)

**Early Warning Signal:** If <50% of users zoom within first session, there's onboarding friction preventing aha moment discovery.

**Measurable Behaviors (Post-Aha Moment):**
- **Historical pattern exploration**: Time spent examining 2021 peak and 2022 bottom periods indicates methodology validation (first-week activity)
- **Critical phase monitoring**: Increased check frequency when Phase Score approaches decision zones (75-85+) vs baseline usage
- **Strategic visit patterns**: 3-5 hub checks per week during phase transitions (not random daily checks showing anxiety)
- **Deep engagement signals**: Average time-on-chart 90+ seconds with active zoom/pan usage (not passive 10-second glances)

**"Aha Moment" Definition:** First instance of zooming into 2021 peak, validating phase score hit 85 before top, and comparing to current trajectory - realization "I can verify this methodology myself"

**Success Milestone:** Marcus makes his first systematic position adjustment (reduces 40% at Phase Score 80+) based on chart exploration rather than Twitter sentiment.

**Sarah Segment (First-Cycle Investors) - Learning Progression (Phase 1.5):**

**Primary Success Indicator:** Sarah develops systematic decision framework, moving from FOMO/panic to confidence in phase-based timing.

**Path to Aha Moment - Leading Indicators:**
- **Tutorial start within 5 minutes** of landing (indicates education path engaged)
- **Completion of Tutorial 1** (2021 peak exploration) in first session (indicates aha moment reached)
- **Return visit within 48 hours** after completing Tutorial 1 (indicates value recognized)

**Early Warning Signal:** If <60% complete Tutorial 1 in first session, educational scaffolding isn't working.

**Measurable Behaviors (Post-Aha Moment):**
- **Tutorial completion**: 70%+ complete all 3 guided historical explorations within first week
- **Tooltip usage declining**: Decreasing reliance on educational overlays over 2-3 months (learning curve)
- **Educational → Advanced toggle**: Switching to streamlined view marks confidence milestone (typically month 2-3)
- **Exploration depth evolution**: Surface-level checks initially → deeper historical pattern analysis over time
- **Time-on-chart increasing**: Early quick glances (30 seconds) → sustained analytical sessions (90+ seconds) as skills develop

**"Aha Moment" Definition:** Completing guided tutorial exploring 2021 peak, seeing phase score hit 85 before top, realizing "there WAS a signal - I can see when smart money exits"

**Success Milestone:** Sarah takes her first profit (50% position at Phase Score 80+) based on framework understanding rather than fear or hype.

**Cross-Segment Engagement Quality Indicators:**
- **Interactive feature usage**: 50%+ of paid members use zoom/pan/historical exploration monthly (separates active users from passive subscribers)
- **Time-aligned engagement**: Hub checks correlating with phase transitions (strategic usage) not random anxiety-driven checks
- **Chart request activity**: Members requesting new analyses (15-20 requests in 6 months from 50-100 members)
- **Community feedback**: Discord mentions of trading decisions influenced by phase scores
- **Referral behavior**: Users telling friends = demonstrated value worth protecting/sharing
- **Trial conversion** (Sarah): 65%+ of $5 trials convert to $20/month after experiencing value

## Business Success

**3-Month Success Criteria:**

**Conversion Performance:**
- **Overall (Marcus-only MVP)**: 10-12% newsletter → paid conversion
  - MVP targets experienced investors exclusively, so overall = Marcus conversion rate
  - Note: Some Sarah-type users may convert despite no educational scaffolding (self-motivated learners)
  - Below 7% = concerning, indicates value prop not resonating with target segment
  - Above 15% = exceptional, validates premium positioning and track record credibility

**Engagement Quality:**
- **Active user rate**: 60%+ of paid members check hub 2+ times per week
  - Below 40% = paying but not using (warning sign)
  - Above 70% = exceptional product stickiness
- **Interactive feature usage**: 50%+ use zoom/pan/historical exploration monthly
  - Below 30% = treating as static image, missing core value (onboarding friction)
- **Average time-on-chart**: 90+ seconds per session (mix of quick checks + deep exploration)
  - Below 30 seconds = passive glancing, not analytical engagement
- **First session zoom rate**: 60%+ zoom within first session (path to aha moment working)

**Retention Validation:**
- **Month 3 retention**: 60%+ (stabilized after initial 20-30% month 1→2 churn)
  - Below 60% = ongoing value not demonstrated
  - This becomes the baseline for evaluating Phase 2 readiness

**Community Validation:**
- Chart requests emerging organically via email/DM (baseline: 5+ requests in first 3 months)
- Unsolicited testimonials about decision confidence and systematic execution
- Discord activity showing members discussing timing decisions influenced by phase scores

**Revenue Momentum:**
- Trajectory toward 50+ members and $750-1,000 MRR by month 6
- Mix of monthly ($20) and annual ($180) subscriptions
- Lifetime purchases ($500) providing development cash cushion

**12-Month Success Vision:**

**Sustainable Revenue Model:**
- 75%+ retention demonstrating ongoing value creation (not one-time curiosity)
- 50-100 paying members generating $750-1,500 MRR
- Annual renewal rates: 75-80% (proves indispensable decision-support tool)

**Community-Driven Roadmap:**
- 15-20 chart requests in first 6 months proving expansion demand
- Pattern validation: 3+ requests for same chart type (not just single power user)
- Segment diversity: Requests from both Marcus AND Sarah segments

**Platform Readiness:**
- Both user segments showing value realization through behavioral metrics
- Proven engagement patterns during phase transitions (validates core value prop)
- Infrastructure tested at 50-100 user scale, ready for Phase 2 expansion

**Phase 1 → Phase 2 Gate (Minimum Viable Success):**

**Core Criteria (ALL must be true):**
1. **Revenue threshold**: 50+ paying members at $15-20/month average = $750-1,000 MRR sustainable
2. **Retention proof**: 75%+ retention after month 3 = proven ongoing value, not one-time purchase
3. **Demand validation**: 10+ chart requests with 2+ recurring patterns = community-driven roadmap justified

**Go/No-Go Decision Framework:**

**PROCEED TO PHASE 2 if:**
- All 3 core criteria met → Strong green light
- 2 of 3 criteria met with 3rd showing strong trajectory (>80% of target) → Conditional green light, set 30-day checkpoint

**PAUSE AND DIAGNOSE if:**
- 2 of 3 criteria met but 3rd stalled (<50% of target) → Identify root cause before proceeding
  - Example: 55 members + 78% retention, but only 3 chart requests → Demand unclear, survey users
- 1 of 3 criteria met → Deep diagnosis required, likely 60-90 day extension before decision

**PIVOT OR ADJUST if:**
- 0 of 3 criteria met after 6 months → Fundamental product-market fit issue
- Red flags dominating (see below) → Core value proposition not working

**Red Flags (Pivot or Adjust):**
- **Poor conversion**: <7% newsletter → paid after 3 months despite promotion (Marcus value prop not resonating)
- **Low retention**: <60% month 3 retention (users not finding ongoing value)
- **No engagement**: Members signing up but rarely checking hub (passive subscribers)
- **Low aha moment rate**: <40% zoom in first session (onboarding friction killing discovery)
- **Zero demand signals**: No chart requests or feature feedback after 90 days (no expansion appetite)
- **Wrong behavior**: Usage patterns show passive viewing, not active exploration

## Technical Success

Technical success focuses on reliable delivery of the core value proposition: daily-updated interactive charts with proprietary timing signals. Technical failures directly impact user trust and business success.

**Pipeline Reliability (Tiered by Market Criticality):**

**Normal Market Conditions (Phase Score 20-80):**
- **Uptime target**: 95% daily successful pipeline executions (~18 failures allowed per year)
- **Recovery SLA**: Failed pipelines debugged and resolved within 24 hours
- **User communication**: "Last updated: X hours ago" prominently displayed on Notion page
- **Rationale**: Most users check occasionally during neutral phases; 24-hour staleness acceptable

**Critical Market Conditions (Phase Score <20 or >80):**
- **Uptime target**: 99% daily successful pipeline executions (~4 failures allowed per year)
- **Recovery SLA**: Failed pipelines debugged and resolved within 4 hours
- **Escalation**: SMS/email alert (not just Discord) for immediate awareness
- **Manual backup**: If pipeline fails, post current phase score manually to Discord/Twitter within 2 hours
- **Rationale**: Users check frequently during decision zones; failures destroy trust at critical moments

**Absolute Limit:**
- **No more than 2 consecutive days** of failed updates during critical market conditions
- 3+ consecutive failures = emergency manual intervention required regardless of time of day

**Data Freshness & Transparency:**
- Phase score calculations updated within 24 hours when source data available
- When pipeline fails: "Last updated: X hours ago" prominently displayed, no hiding staleness
- Expectation-setting commentary: "Calculations updated daily when data available (typically within 24 hours)"

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
- Discord webhook notification for all pipeline executions: "✅ Phase score updated - BTC: $X, Score: Y"
- Discord alert on failure: "⚠️ Pipeline failed - check logs"
- SMS/email escalation if Phase Score in critical zone (<20 or >80)
- Weekly uptime report tracking normal vs critical period reliability separately

**Chart Performance:**
- **Load time**: Chart renders in <2 seconds on standard broadband (10 Mbps)
- **Interaction smoothness**: Zoom/pan operations at 60fps (no lag or stuttering)
- **Browser compatibility**: Chart functions correctly on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- **Responsive design**: Chart displays properly on desktop (1920x1080) and tablet (1024x768) viewports
- **Data visualization accuracy**: BTC price and phase score overlay with correct dynamic rescaling

**Data Accuracy & Validation:**
- **Calculation correctness**: Phase score calculations match manual validation 100% when spot-checked
- **Source data integrity**: LTH SOPR and LTH MVRV source data validated against Glassnode/CryptoQuant baselines monthly
- **Historical consistency**: Backtested phase scores for 2021 peak (85 at Nov 2021) and 2022 bottom (12 at Nov 2022) remain stable
- **Transparency**: Methodology documentation allows independent verification of calculation logic

**Access Control & Security:**
- **Referer validation**: Netlify edge function correctly blocks non-Notion referers (prevents public chart exposure)
- **Token infrastructure**: Token parameter support built and tested (ready for Phase 2 enforcement)
- **Notion embedding**: Chart embeds correctly in Notion pages without rendering issues
- **Payment integration**: Stripe/Gumroad subscription webhooks correctly grant/revoke Notion access

**Infrastructure Scalability:**
- **Single HTML deployment**: Daily automated updates to Netlify deploy successfully
- **CDN performance**: Netlify CDN serves chart HTML globally with <100ms latency
- **Concurrent user capacity**: Chart supports 50-100 concurrent users without performance degradation
- **Cost efficiency**: Infrastructure costs remain <$50/month at 100-user scale

**Success Milestone:** 30 consecutive days of successful pipeline execution during normal conditions with zero user-reported chart rendering issues.

## Success Interdependencies

Success dimensions are interconnected - technical excellence enables user aha moments, which drive business metrics. Understanding these causal paths helps diagnose problems faster.

**Critical Success Paths:**

**Path 1: Technical Performance → User Aha Moment → Business Conversion**
- Chart loads in <2 seconds (technical) →
- Marcus explores immediately, not bouncing (user engagement) →
- Marcus zooms into 2021 peak within 2 minutes (user aha moment) →
- Marcus converts and subscribes (business metric: 10-12% conversion)

**Failure Mode:** If chart takes 5+ seconds to load, Marcus bounces before reaching aha moment → <5% conversion → Miss Phase 2 gate

**Path 2: Pipeline Reliability → User Trust → Business Retention**
- Pipeline runs daily during critical periods (technical: 99% uptime in decision zones) →
- Marcus checks during Phase Score 78→82 transition and sees fresh data (user trust building) →
- Marcus makes systematic decision based on current score (user value realization) →
- Marcus renews subscription (business metric: 75%+ retention)

**Failure Mode:** Pipeline fails when Phase Score crosses 80 → Marcus sees stale data during decision moment → Loses trust in "real-time" positioning → Churns → <60% retention → Pivot required

**Path 3: User Onboarding → Engagement → Retention**
- Notion page clearly invites chart interaction (user onboarding) →
- 60%+ zoom within first session (user aha moment rate) →
- Users return 3-5x per week during phase transitions (user engagement pattern) →
- 60%+ active rate sustained (business metric) →
- 75%+ retention after month 3 (business metric)

**Failure Mode:** Methodology explainer overwhelms users before chart interaction → <40% zoom in first session → Users don't reach aha moment → 40% active rate → 50% retention → Miss Phase 2 gate

**Path 4: Chart Requests → Product Expansion → Revenue Growth**
- Users explore chart and think "I wish I could see [X metric]" (user engagement depth) →
- 15-20 chart requests via email/DM in 6 months (business metric: demand validation) →
- 3+ requests for same chart type (business metric: pattern validation) →
- Phase 2 expansion justified (strategic decision) →
- 3-5 new charts launched (product growth) →
- 200-300 members engaging with multi-chart platform (revenue growth)

**Failure Mode:** Users treat chart passively, no exploration depth → Zero chart requests after 90 days → No demand signal for expansion → Phase 2 not justified → Platform remains single-chart, limited growth potential

**Diagnostic Questions Using Interdependencies:**

**If at month 3 you see:**
- ✅ 95% pipeline uptime (technical)
- ❌ 45% active engagement rate (business)
- ❌ 50% retention (business)

**Trace the failure path:**
→ Pipeline uptime isn't the bottleneck
→ Check: Are users reaching aha moments? (% who zoom in first session)
→ If <50% zoom rate: **Onboarding friction issue** - Notion page needs redesign
→ If 60%+ zoom rate: **Value delivery issue** - Chart insights not actionable enough

**If at month 3 you see:**
- ✅ 65% zoom rate in first session (user aha moment)
- ✅ 70% active engagement (business)
- ❌ Pipeline failed 3 times during critical periods (technical)

**Trace the risk:**
→ Users ARE reaching aha moments and engaging
→ But pipeline failures during decision zones will erode trust
→ **Fix technical reliability BEFORE it tanks retention**
→ Implement tiered SLA and manual backup for critical periods

This causal modeling enables proactive intervention rather than reactive firefighting.
